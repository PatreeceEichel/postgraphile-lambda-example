# PostGraphile Lambda Example

## Overview

This project shows an example of how you might use PostGraphile on Lambda. It
has the following aims:

- [x] Startup without needing to introspect database
- [x] Fast startup
- [x] Small bundle size
- [x] JWT auth supported OOTB
- [x] Graphile-build schema plugin support
- [x] Support for middlewares
- [x] No requirement for Node.js `http`-based libraries (such as Connect,
      Express, Koa)

## Non-goals

Postgraphile-lambda-example does NOT intend to watch the schema for changes;
this means that you _must_ build and release a new version every time you
change your database. (You only need to update the cache file though.)

Postgraphile-lambda-example does NOT intend to make this fully compatible with
the `postgraphile` CLI - this will be a subset best suited to Lambda usage.

Postgraphile-lambda-example does NOT intend to support subscriptions.

## Method

We use the following tools:

- webpack - to bundle up the required code into as small a file as possible
  (no need for `node_modules` any more!)
- PostGraphile `writeCache` / `readCache` - we'll introspect the database
  during the build and write the results to a cache file to be included in the
  bundle; then when the Lambda service starts up it can read from the cache
  rather than introspecting the database again.
- serverless.js (optional) - for automated AWS deployments.

## Setup

First clone this repository locally, and install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Next, set up a `.env` file matching your environment:

```
cp .env.template .env
```

And modify the `src/postgraphileOptions.js` and `serverless.yml` files to your taste.

## Automatic Deployment with Serverless.js

#### Deployment Prerequisites

- [serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/) - `yarn global add serverless`

After configuring your `.env` file, ~/.aws/credentials, and postgraphileOptions.js, you can deploy to AWS using serverless.js by running:

```
yarn deploy
```

## Setting up a Lambda endpoint manually

If you prefer not to use the serverless.jsÂ framework, you can also deploy your lambda function manually.

Note 1: Change your process.env.AWS_STAGE_NAME to "/default" to match the default stage name for manually deployed API Gateways.

Note 2: CORS is enabled by default. Remove cors() middleware in `/src/index.js` if you would prefer disabled cors.

0. Run `yarn build` to create `lambda.zip` file that you can upload to Amazon Lambda.
1. Visit https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home and click 'Create function'
2. Select "Author from scratch" and give your function a name, select the most recent Node.js release (at least 8.10+), create (or select) a role (I granted "Simple microservice permissions")
3. Click "Create function" and wait about 15 seconds; you should be greeted with a "Congratulations" message.
4. Scroll to "Function code", select "Upload a .zip file" from "Code entry type", press the "Upload" button and select the `lambda.zip` file you generated above; then click "Save"
5. Scroll to "Environment variables" and enter your `DATABASE_SCHEMAS` and `DATABASE_URL` settings; then click "Save"
6. Scroll to the top and select "API Gateway" under "Add triggers" in the "Designer", then scroll to "Configure triggers"
7. Create a new API; if you like add 'image/gif', 'image/png', 'image/icon' and 'image/x-icon' to the list of binary media types; then press "Add" followed by "Save"
8. Click the name of the API gateway to go to the API gateway config
9. Select the `/` route under `Resources` and from the "Actions" dropdown, select "Create method" add create an `ANY` method
10. Turn on "Lambda Proxy Integration" and enter your lambda function name in the relevant box, then press "Save"
11. Finally, go to "Actions" again and "Deploy API"
12. Copy the "Invoke URL" and paste it into your GraphQL client of choice - you can now talk to your Lambda PostGraphile API ðŸ˜…

If you want GraphiQL support (STRONGLY DISCOURAGED! Use an external GraphQL
client such as GraphiQL.app, Altair or GraphQL Playground instead!), then you
need to go back to stage 9, and choose 'Create Resource', tick "Configure as a
proxy resource", press "Create Resource" and then configure it with the name of
your lambda function, you should also change the settings in
`src/postgraphileOptions.js` (see comment in that file).

## How it works

### Phases

The system operates based on a number of phases. Each phase depends on the
previous non-optional phase; so if an earlier phase rebuilds then all later
phases must also rebuild.

#### Phase 1: build postgraphile: `scripts/build`

Uses webpack to produce a single JS file containing all that is necessary,
using `src/index.js` as the entry point.

Compiles `src/**` to `dist/`

**Start here when**: you change your code, add/remove plugins, or upgrade dependencies.

#### Phase 2: generate cache: `scripts/generate-cache`

Uses a similar approach to `postgraphile --write-cache` to write a cache file
containing introspection details of your database.

Generates `dist/postgraphile.cache`

**Start here when**: database schema changes.

#### Phase 3: bundle: `scripts/bundle`

Produce a zip file combining the two artifacts above - `dist/index.js` and `dist/postgraphile.cache`.

Generates `lambda.zip` from `dist/` folder

#### Phase 4 (optional): test: `scripts/test`

Launch the bundle in the `sam local` test environment, and run a series of requests.

**Manual checking of the results is required.**

#### Phase 5: upload to Lambda

Left as an exercise to the reader.

### Test Prerequisites

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [aws sam cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/sam-cli-requirements.html) - `pip install aws-sam-cli`

### Running tests

Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

Copy .env.template to .env and customize as you like:

```
cp .env.template .env
```

If you're using the default `.env.template` file then you'll need to populate the
`postgraphile_forum_example` database:

```
./scripts/import-example-database
```

Make sure that the query in `test/query.graphql` and the options in `src/postgraphileOptions.js` are both valid for your database. If you're using a remote PostgreSQL server (or one within a docker instance), you may need to update the `host.docker.internal` reference in `test/make-template-yml.sh` (line 15).

Run the tests:

```
yarn test
```

Note the first run might take a while whilst the system installs the relevant
docker images.

In the test output you should see a number of `0 error(s)` statements, and some successful GraphQL HTTP request payloads

### Running local sam instance

Do the same as for the test, but instead of running `yarn test` at the end, instead run:

```
yarn sam
```

This will set up a local GraphQL endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:3000/graphql

You can then use a GraphQL client such as Altair or GraphQL Playground to issue requests.

If you're using the sample database then you can generate a JWT via:

```graphql
mutation {
  authenticate(input: { email: "spowell0@noaa.gov", password: "iFbWWlc" }) {
    jwtToken
  }
}
```

Then set the JWT header:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoiZm9ydW1fZXhhbXBsZV9wZXJzb24iLCJwZXJzb25faWQiOjEsImlhdCI6MTUzODEyOTEyMSwiZXhwIjoxNTM4MjE1NTIxLCJhdWQiOiJwb3N0Z3JhcGhpbGUiLCJpc3MiOiJwb3N0Z3JhcGhpbGUifQ.NFZ10gvIB29VL1p3Wh-Cc74JSigOOhgtqaMCP9ZA2W0"
}
```

Then you can issue an authenticated query:

```graphql
{
  currentPerson {
    nodeId
    id
    fullName
  }
}
```

Note that SAM unpacks the zip and reboots node for every single request, so you're going to suffer some startup latency with this.
